Zello, beautiful World!

I make a first change and commit it (locally). Some more info for the master branch.

More master stuff.

And now a second change. I am going to commit is as well (locally) and then push it (to remote). Let's see when the happy hour starts. 

This time, I will stage and commit in one command.
 
And a nother change in testing.
Even more testing stuff.

And now for some remote branching and even more braching and testing.

Another line for testing multiline comments. More stuff.

Lalalala. Foobar. Rhubarb. I like cake.

I wonder what the network graph of ggomes looks like after he pulls the latest version.

Now I will add some more text here and then merge it into the refactor branch, where this file is located in a different directory. I wonder whether git correctly merges these changes.
